# ASCIIthyan
The NodeJS app to convert images to ascii, optionally animated.

# Main goal
Just for fun.

# The concept
Well. I split the image to the pixel map of NDarray. 
Then I analyse the mail color of the pre-chosen square.
Then I choose the symbol according to the amount of black on the square.
Then I concatenate the right symbol to the whole phrase. Voila!
